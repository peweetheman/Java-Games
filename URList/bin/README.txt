Lab 5 involved implementing a linked list and array list in java, from a given node and URList class.
There were 19 methods in the URList that needed to be implemented, and eight additional
methods that were implemented specific to the class.
The arraylist class used an array called elementData to store data while the linked list class
used nodes that were connected with methods prev() and next() to store data.
